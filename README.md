Relational Database & Restful API Development Project

This project showcases the basic understanding(s) of developing and maintaining a relational database and using rest to management data manipulation. The main focus was developing a backend-server using Python to manage data for a fictional ecommerce flask application. The following tables were developed using Flask/SQLAlchemy/Marshmallow and Postman:

1. Users
   Creates and handle users' general data:
    a. Name
    b. Email
    c. Password
   
2. Products
   Creates and handle products' general data:
    a. Name
    b. Description
    c. Price
   
3. Orders
   Creates and handle orders' general data:
    a. User/Consumer
    b. Products
   
4. Order_Product
   Stores both a specific order and product(s)

NOTE - Every table has an ID (PK) that automatically increment with each new additional data.

This project incorperates CRUD (Database)/ GET/POST/PUT/DELETE (Postman) operations to manage data into the each respective table.
